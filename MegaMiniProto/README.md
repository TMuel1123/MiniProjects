MegaMiniProto
============

This is a shield for the last third of the Arduino Mega2560.

![Board](https://raw.github.com/TMuel1123/MiniProjects/master/MegaMiniProto/img.png)

* It covers the pins 14-53 and A8-A15. These pins include USART 1-3 (14-19), I2C (20,21), PWM (44-46) and SPI (50-53).
* It still fits onto the Arduino Mega2560 if a normal shield ia connected to the Arduino Mega.
* The gerber files in the zip file ./Gerber+brd/MegaMiniProto.zip can be directly uploaded to OSHPark.com to order it.

Revision 1.1
------------
* Made the text more bold on the top and bottom silk screen. Now it has the eagle setting size 32mil ratio 12%. The ratio of 12% seems to be the minimum that can be cleanly printed
